    <h1>maggie masala</h1>
    <img src="maggie.jpg" alt = "aaloo-paratha" height = "310"width = "510">
    <p>In 1869, Julius Maggi (1846-1912) took over his father's mill business in Kemptthal, Switzerland. Under his leadership, the
         business developed into one of the pioneers of industrial food production, with the aim of improving the diet of working-class 
         families through better nutrient supply and faster preparation</p>
    <p>In 1882, at a meeting of the Swiss "Common Good Society" (Gemeinnützigen Gesellschaft), the doctor and factory inspector Fridolin 
        Schuler spoke about the miserable nutritional situation of the factory workers: women workers no longer had enough time to cook 
        for their families; cold meals or alcohol often replaced warm meals; meals were served in factory canteens and were cheap but not 
        sufficiently nutritious. The consequences were malnutrition, stomach diseases, and high infant mortality. Schuler advocated for diets 
        based on high-protein, easily digestible pulses/legumes. He demanded that such meals should be offered to the working class in a 
        convenient form for quick preparation and at a low price. The society turned to the Maggi company, among others. </p>
