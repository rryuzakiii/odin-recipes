    <p>Aloo parathas are mostly served as a breakfast dish along with dahi (plain yogurt), 
       or yogurt dips called raita. Sometimes, Athana (Indian pickle), chutney and masala chai are also served along with it.</p>
    <p>In the 21st century, due to convenience, working routines, rising household incomes, smaller families and time restrictions, 
        the aloo paratha breakfast for urban Indians has been increasingly replaced by foods seen as more convenient such as cereals.
         A similar pattern has been observed among Central Valley Sikhs in America.</p>
