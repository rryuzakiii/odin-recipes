    <h1>Kolkata Egg Roll</h1>
    <img src="egg-roll.jpg" alt = "Egg Roll" height = "310"width = "510">
    <p>Indian egg rolls, also known as "Kathi rolls" or simply "egg rolls," have a rich history rooted in the street
      food culture of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), West Bengal. The concept originated in the early 20th century, with 
      Nizam's, a popular eatery established in 1932, often credited with inventing the Kathi roll. Initially, they served
      kebabs on skewers (known as "kathi" in Bengali) but later innovated by wrapping these kebabs in parathas to make them 
      more portable and convenient for customers</p>
    <p>Over time, the concept evolved, and one of the most popular variations emerged by adding a layer of egg to the paratha
         before wrapping it around the filling. This egg layer enhanced the flavor and richness of the roll, making it a beloved 
         street food. The popularity of egg rolls spread beyond Kolkata to other parts of India, becoming a common street food item
          in many cities and often customized with various fillings such as chicken, mutton, vegetables, or paneer. Today, Indian 
          egg rolls are cherished for their delicious taste and convenience, embodying a fusion of tradition and innovation in Indian 
        cuisine.</p>
